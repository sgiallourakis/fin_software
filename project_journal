--TODAYS GOAL--
	Today the goal is to write code that can detect any correlations between the stock price of
company who is a commodity based company. Our typical example of this is Taseko Mines (TGB).
TGB own an opperates a copper mine. That is all they do.
	
	So the question we are asking today (and have been for some time) is, does the price of 
commodities effect the stock price of companies like TGB, who are solely based around that commodity.
Now I my initial assumption is that yes. If copper prices increase, then the associated stock price
will increase (If P incr. then Q incr. ). 
	---- The opposite is also assumed in this case. (If P dec. then Q dec.) 

	The more nuanced question though is how much is the stock price affected.

So in total, todays goals are as follows:
	
	1)  Establish correlation between stock price and commodity price.
	2)  What is the magnitude of the effect of the correlation?
