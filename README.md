The purpose of this project is to bring together data science tools and machine learning tools to 
 create a web based software to assist in stock investment decisions.

 	--Stock Analysis--
 			-- Understanding stock behavior historically.
 			-- Find correlations between news/commodities (if applicable)/.
 		These tools will not be a long term predictor. They will be focused on making accurate decisions
 		 over reasonable time frames.


 	--Design--

 		- Front end design will be handled by pico.css. This is a lightweight framework that is easy to get up and running and has a nice minimalist asstetic.
