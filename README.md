	#Financial Software
	###Creator - Steven Giallourakis
 		- The purpose of this project is to bring together data science tools and machine learning tools to create a web based software to assist in stock investment decisions.

 	##Stock Analysis
 		- Understanding stock behavior historically.
 		- Find correlations between news/commodities (if applicable)/.
 		- These tools will not be a long term predictor. They will be focused on making accurate decisions over reasonable time frames.

 	##CURRENT STATE:
 	###NOTE: ALL CODE IS IN TESTING PHASE.


   		###DATABASE
    		- The initial datbase has been built using PostgreSQL. 

   		###UNDERLYING CODE
    		- The data acquisition functions have been built and tested. I am able to pull in any stock or commodity data I need.
    		- The code also supports pulling in news articles, titles and headlines. The sentiment analysis has not been built in yet but that is the next step.

   		##FRONT END DESIGN
    		- Initial designs are underway. I will be using REACT and Pico.css. 
    		- Pico.css is a lightweight framework that is easy to get up and running and has a nice minimalist asstetic.
