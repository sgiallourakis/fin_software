--TODAYS GOALS--
		The goal for today is to write code to test for a correlation between "the price of a commodity" and "the stock price" of a company
	whose main business is closely related to said commodity. (If P then S). To be more precise (If P inc then S inc).

	For any question realated to commodities, I typically use Taseko Mines (TGB) as my test case. I choose TGB because they own a copper mine, of the largest in the US, full stop. That is all they do. So they are the simplest case in my opinion. This will obviously be more thouroghly tested. Today is simply can we ouptut an answer and does the output make sense. 

	-PLAN-
		1 - Ingest data for TASEKO MINES and Copper Prices.
		2 - Store "End of Day" Prices for each in NUMPY ARRAYS.
		3 - Run analysis on each of these sets of data.
				a -  Using "End of Day" prices assess trend of prices and compare them with stock prices.



	NOTES FROM THE DAY
	Should not have ever assumed that I could have completed all of this today. Its Sunday. On the bright side I have learned a lot and did make some progress. I have first part of the data injestion coded up. The new funcion "av_pull", pulls data from alpha vantage and saves the data as a json file. This was done for a couple of different reason. First, i want minimize the pings to alpha vantage. As a free account there are limitations to the number api request we can ping them for each day. Secondly, offline data allows for offline analysis.

	--NEW FUNCTION--

	av_pull -- {symbol, interval, apikey}
			- {symbol} = the stock symbol for uou particular stock
					EX: Taseko Mines mines {symbol} = TGB

			- {interval} = the length of intervals we would like to request from alph_vantage. The example i am using is requesting
				all transactions to be in 1 min intervals. 
					NOTE -- in testing for taseko mines it is pulling in larger intervals. I do believe this is becuase there aren't
						as many transactions as some something like NVIDIA.
					EX: 1 Minute Interval -> '1min' = {interval}

			- {apikey} = is the key we use for accessing alpha vantage api.
					EX: 5623H2384H108384H2123 = apikey
					NOTE--As of right now this would need to requested form Steven directly.

--TODAYS GOAL--
		Todays goal is to finish creating the functions needed to completely injest data and prepare it for analysis. Yesterday's goals were
	ambitious. I need to be more thourogh in my though process. Instead of jumping into analysis i should be laying the infrastructure for all possible goals. This means creating injested tools for different types of data and preparing the database needed to perform accurate and good queries of data. This means not just storing json files, but putting those files into a database for proper data storage.

	--PLAN--
	Create the following functions:
		json_to_database
			- this function will update the database with any json data

		database_check
			- this function will check the database for any data related to the requested stock. If data exists it will display the date that
			the data was last updated. The purpose of this is to give the user the option to update the data or use it as is.
