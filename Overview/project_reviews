Current State of fin_software
 -- This document will keep records of the current state of the project. This means that every week I will take deep dive into what work has been completed. I want to be able to track the full progress of the project. Not just my daily goals. This document will be formal in nature. 

 AS I AM ONE PERSON, I HAVE CHOSEN TO NOT USE ANY WEB SOFTWARE TO MANAGE THESE TYPES OF ISSUES. AS THE PROJECT GROWS I WILL COME BACK TO THIS.

 Each update will need to be formatted as follows:

 ----- DATE OF REVIEW -----
